### _**Description**_
Everyone experiences exhaustion but its all mental in some cases. I know I wasn't the only person punching the air because of Malenia in **Elden Ring**. We all just need a place to just woosah and put down the controller.

Thats what the ***Gamers Asylum*** is here for. In the Asylum, We leave *reviews* on *games* to see if anyone else out there is having a similar problem with a boss or a puzzle. Thats when our *comments* section comes in on our *reviews*. You could end find a party for a raid or a gaming guru to tell you a shortcut. Whatever it takes to go from Tweaking Timmy to just tired Goku.
