            <h3>What is The Asylum</h3>
            <br />
            <p>Gamer's Asylum is a place for any Gamer that wants to seek refuge from Malenia or Sephiroth. 
            This space is basically an open forum for gamers in trouble or gamers who just like feeling helpful to newbs.
            Our users understand the importance of a good raid party or the secrets to unlocking the strongest weapon in game.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Gamers will leave a Review with a Description of the situation they're facing currently.
            Other gamers would only have to leave a Comment on the Review and just like that, another Gamer has been freed from the shackles of a secret boss or even a regular overpowered one.
